Ledder is working on a decentralized advertising platform that will join individual advertising billboards into a single network and enables advertising platforms to place advertising content on any billboard anywhere in the world. 

Ledder is developing new super light digital billboards that are 10 times cheaper to manufacture than the existing solutions. Our billboards will use the energy of the sun (via screen surface). The billboards will be maintained using drones.
